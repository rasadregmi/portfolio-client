          Although I do not have formal work experience, my academic coursework and personal projects have equipped me with valuable skills and knowledge. I have a solid foundation in <strong>web development</strong>, particularly in the <strong>MERN stack & Next.js</strong>.

        <p className="text-base md:text-lg font-sans leading-relaxed">
          I have actively participated in <strong>MBMC IdeaX 2024</strong>, <strong>Orbit Engineering Hacks 2024</strong>, and <strong>Noskathon Lite 2024</strong>, where my team (Team Aegis) and I developed several projects. Through these experiences, I gained hands-on expertise in <strong>full-stack development</strong> and <strong>AI/ML</strong>, collaborated with a team to solve real-world problems, and learned to work effectively under time constraints.

          Additionally, I contributed to <strong>ClassLens</strong>, an AI-powered classroom attentiveness monitoring system that analyzes student engagement using <strong>machine learning</strong>, and <strong>Traffic Dai</strong>, a real-time <strong>traffic-based travel assistant</strong> optimized for Nepalâ€™s unique road conditions. These experiences have strengthened my <strong>problem-solving abilities, teamwork, and proficiency</strong> in <strong>Python, Java, C++, and ML frameworks (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn)</strong>.
